# NMRInversions.jl

This package can be used to easily perform numerical inversions for 1D and 2D NMR relaxation and diffusion measurements.

The default method is Tikhonov regularization, where the optimal smoothing term is determinded through generalized cross-validation.

A GUI is implemented as an extension through the use of the GLMakie package, which enables interactive visualisation for 2D NMR experiments.

For more details, please refer to the documentation.
