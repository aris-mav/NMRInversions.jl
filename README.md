This package can be used to easily perform numerical inversions for 1D and 2D NMR relaxation and diffusion measurements.

A GUI is implemented as an extension through the use of the [GLMakie](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl) package, which enables interactive visualisation for 2D NMR maps.

For more details, please refer to the documentation.

If you have any problems or questions, please feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/arismavridis/NMRInversions.jl/issues).
