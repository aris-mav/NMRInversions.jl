    abstract = {Spin relaxation is a sensitive probe of molecular structure and dynamics. Correlation of relaxation time constants, such as T1 and T2, conceptually similar to the conventional multidimensional spectroscopy, have been difficult to determine primarily due to the absense of an efficient multidimensional Laplace inversion program. We demonstrate the use of a novel computer algorithm for fast two-dimensional inverse Laplace transformation to obtain T1–T2 correlation functions. The algorithm efficiently performs a least-squares fit on two-dimensional data with a nonnegativity constraint. We use a regularization method to find a balance between the residual fitting errors and the known noise amplitude, thus producing a result that is found to be stable in the presence of noise. This algorithm can be extended to include functional forms other than exponential kernels. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm at different signal-to-noise ratios and with different T1–T2 spectral characteristics using several brine-saturated rock samples.}

    abstract = {The mathematics of inverse problems has relevance across numerous estimation problems in science and engineering. L1 regularization has attracted recent attention in reconstructing the system properties in the case of sparse inverse problems; i.e., when the true property sought is not adequately described by a continuous distribution, in particular in Compressed Sensing image reconstruction. In this work, we focus on the application of L1 regularization to a class of inverse problems; relaxation-relaxation, T1–T2, and diffusion-relaxation, D–T2, correlation experiments in NMR, which have found widespread applications in a number of areas including probing surface interactions in catalysis and characterizing fluid composition and pore structures in rocks. We introduce a robust algorithm for solving the L1 regularization problem and provide a guide to implementing it, including the choice of the amount of regularization used and the assignment of error estimates. We then show experimentally that L1 regularization has significant advantages over both the Non-Negative Least Squares (NNLS) algorithm and Tikhonov regularization. It is shown that the L1 regularization algorithm stably recovers a distribution at a signal to noise ratio<20 and that it resolves relaxation time constants and diffusion coefficients differing by as little as 10%. The enhanced resolving capability is used to measure the inter and intra particle concentrations of a mixture of hexane and dodecane present within porous silica beads immersed within a bulk liquid phase; neither NNLS nor Tikhonov regularization are able to provide this resolution. This experimental study shows that the approach enables discrimination between different chemical species when direct spectroscopic discrimination is impossible, and hence measurement of chemical composition within porous media, such as catalysts or rocks, is possible while still being stable to high levels of noise.}
