Welcome to the NMRInversions.jl package!

The goal is to provide an easy-to-use interface to process NMR 
relaxation and diffusion data, completely free/open-source, and fully 
written in Julia.

Functionality includes :
- Importing NMR data from various instrument manufacturers.
- Performing numerical inversions and exponential fits with sensible default settings.
- Interactive visualization of results, through the GLMakie extension.

Hopefully this documentation will provide all the information you need to get started.

- The [Theory](theory.md) section should provide some info on what the package is about.
- For more details on how to use it, you can start by refering to the 
  [tutorial](tutorial.md) section.
- To understand how things really work, have a look at the 
  [Functions](functions.md) and [Types and Structures](types_structs.md) sections.
- If you have any problems or questions, please feel free to 
  [submit an issue](https://github.com/aris-mav/NMRInversions.jl/issues).
- If you would like to contribute to the package, you may start with one of 
  the [existing issues](https://github.com/aris-mav/NMRInversions.jl/issues).
  Please feel free to create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests)
  if you'd like to implement a feature, or start a 
  [discussion](https://github.com/aris-mav/NMRInversions.jl/discussions) 
  if you're unsure about anything or need further guidance.
