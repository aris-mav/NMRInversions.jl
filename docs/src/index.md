Welcome to the NMRInversions.jl package!

Hopefully this documentation will provide all the information you need to get started.

You can download the Julia programming language by following [this link](https://julialang.org/downloads/).
Afterwards, you can either use the julia console (aka REPL) 
by finding the Julia .exe file in your computer, or you can use VScode,
which provides an environment similar to MATLAB with the use of the 
[julia extension](https://www.julia-vscode.org/)
(follow link for installation instructions). 
Of course, if you already have a preferred development workflow 
and you know what you're doing, by all means go for it.

The package can be installed by running the following command on the julia console:
```
using Pkg ; Pkg.add("NMRInversions")
```
This needs to be done only once (unless you swap environment, more on that [here](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments/)).

Afterwards, you can use the package by running `using NMRInversions` in your julia console,
every time you start a new session.

For more details on how to use the package, you can start by refering to the [tutorial](tutorial.md) section.
