Welcome to NMRInversions.jl!

The goal is to provide an easy-to-use interface to process NMR 
relaxation and diffusion data, completely free/open-source, and fully 
written in Julia.

Functionality includes :
- Importing NMR data from various instrument manufacturers.
- Performing numerical inversions and exponential fits with sensible default settings.
- Interactive visualization of results, through the GLMakie extension.

Who would want to use this package :
- Researchers in chemistry, physics, and materials science who rely on NMR 
  to study molecular dynamics, diffusion and interactions. 
  NMRInversions.jl simplifies the process of data analysis, allowing researchers 
  to focus on their scientific questions rather than the intricacies of data processing.
- Professionals in various fields such as food science, subsurface applications, 
  or materials engineering can utilize this package to analyze NMR data for quality 
  control, product development, and research purposes. 
- Students learning about NMR techniques can benefit from a straightforward tool 
  that helps them understand data processing and analysis. 
  Educators can use the package as a teaching aid in courses related to NMR or 
  inverse problems.

Hopefully this documentation will provide all the information you need to get started.

- The [Theory](theory.md) section should provide some info on what the package is really about.
- For more details on how to use it, you can start by refering to the examples in the  
  [tutorial](tutorial.md).
- To understand how things really work, have a look at the 
  [Functions](functions.md) and [Types and Structures](types_structs.md) sections.
- If you have any problems or questions, please feel free to 
  [submit an issue](https://github.com/aris-mav/NMRInversions.jl/issues).
