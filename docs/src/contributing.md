If you would like to contribute to the package, you may start with one of 
the [existing issues](https://github.com/aris-mav/NMRInversions.jl/issues).
Please feel free to create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests)
if you'd like to implement a feature. Stanard [Julia style]
(https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/style-guide/) 
is recommended, and writing tests for any new (or existing) features would be nice.

If you're unsure about anything or need further guidance, feel free to start a
[discussion](https://github.com/aris-mav/NMRInversions.jl/discussions).
